Challenge :
Check if the user data for registering an account is valid.

Data is valid if:

1. Properties are not empty.
2. Username has at least 6 characters.
3. Password has at least 10 characters.
4. The email contains a '@' and a â€˜.`.

Hint: use the `contains()` function on a String to check if a value is contained in it.
Hint: use the `isEmpty()` function on a String to check if the string is empty.
Example: email.isEmpty()

Use `if` as an expression, to assign a respective error message if any of the cases fail! Then print it out.

The messages are prepared for you in the project.
