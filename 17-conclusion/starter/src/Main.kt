  * Challenge:
  * Using an array of the days of the week, practice your collections skills.
  * 1. Change the value of an element by accessing them using an index.
  * 2. Add one element, and remove one element, e.g. add another Friday, remove Monday! :]
  * Note: Arrays cannot change their size. First convert to a MutableList. To convert, use `toMutableList()` on the Array.
  * 3. Print the changed List to check that all the elements are there.
  * 4. After removing an element, check if it's in the list, and print the result.
