  * Challenge 1:
  * Print numbers from 1 to 15, using a while loop.

  * Challenge 2:
  * Create an array or list of names. Using a do-while loop, and an iterator, print the names in a reverse order.
  * Make sure to check that the iterator is within the bounds of the array's size. (from `lastIndex` to 0).
