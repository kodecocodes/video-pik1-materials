fun main() {
  /* Challenge :
  * Check if the user data for registering an account is valid. Data is valid if:
  *
  * 1. Properties are not empty.
  * 2. Username has at least 6 characters.
  * 3. Password has at least 10 characters.
  * 4. The email contains a '@' and a ‘.`.
  *
  * Hint: use the `contains()` function on a String.
  *
  * Use `if` as an expression, to assign a respective error message if any of the cases fail! Then print it out.
  *
  * The appropriate String messages are:
  * 1. All values are empty -> "You must fill in your data!"
  * 2. Username is too short -> "Username needs to be at least 6 characters long!"
  * 3. Password is too short -> "Password needs to be at least 10 characters long!"
  * 4. Email doesn't contain a '@' or a '.' -> "Invalid email format."
  * 5. Every field is valid -> "Successful registration!"
  *
  * Print out the respective message!
  * */
